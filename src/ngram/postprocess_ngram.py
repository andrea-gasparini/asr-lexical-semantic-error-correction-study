"""
There is a small problem that ðŸ¤— Transformers will not be happy about later on.
The n-gram correctly includes a "Unknown" or <unk>, as well as a begin-of-sentence, <s> token, but no end-of-sentence, </s> token.
This sadly has to be corrected currently after the build.

We can simply add the end-of-sentence token by adding the line 0 </s> $begin_of_sentence_score below the <s> token
and increasing the ngram 1 count by 1.
